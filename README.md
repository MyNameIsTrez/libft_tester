# libft_tester

This is my tester for my functions in libft.

## How to run my tests

`make`

It always includes the bonuses.

You can press `F5` in VS Code to have its debugger run that command for you.

## How vectors.c works

See my other repository's description [here](https://github.com/MyNameIsTrez/c-vector).
